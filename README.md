This is a Weather App. It's function is to display a weather report of the location that the user inputs. If the user wants to see the weather outlook for a given city. 

By searching up a city in the search bar, the user is shown the weather outlook of the current day. The search will also show the forecast of the next 5 days showing the temperature and humidity and a weather icon that represents the weather conditions. 

In the main weather card the user can view the UV index that is color coded indicating if weather is favorable.

The cities in the sidebar holds a list of cities that were previously searched. By clicking on the cities in the search history the user will be shown the display for that location. The search history can be cleared by clicking on the clear button, which removes the data held in the localStorage and reloads the page. 

Searched cities will be stored in a localStorage, so when you refresh the page the search history will load and update.
